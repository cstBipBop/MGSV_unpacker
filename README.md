# MGSV_unpacker

.cmd file that makes use of Atvaark's tools for unpacking MGSV:TPP game files. config.txt uses simple boolean values for setting up the way the command file runs. Detailed individual tool creator info and links to their repositories will be added later, as well as detailed usage. lang and qar dictionaries are the result of modder community efforts.
